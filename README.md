Square Payment Gateway for WHMCS

With our e-commerce API, you can take payments with Square on your own website.

Square Checkout lets merchants accept online payments for supported payment types using a checkout workflow hosted on squareup.com that simplifies the process of accepting online payments by providing:

    Chargeback protection for qualifying transactions.
    Next business day deposits.
    PCI compliance.
    SSL support.

While SSL is not required to use Checkout, Square strongly recommends that merchant sites be SSL certified to reduce the risk of man-in-the-middle attacks.
